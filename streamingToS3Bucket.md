```
The code uses the AWS SDK for Node.js to perform multipart uploads to S3 using `UploadPartCommand`, `CreateMultipartUploadCommand`, and `CompleteMultipartUploadCommand` classes.

Here's how the code works:

1. The function `uploadFileToS3` is defined, which takes in a `req` and `res` object representing the HTTP request and response, respectively. These are used to handle the file upload.

2. A new instance of `Busboy` is created, passing in the headers from the incoming request.

3. S3 parameters for the multipart upload are defined in `params`, including the S3 bucket name, object key, and content type.

4. Variables are declared to keep track of the upload ID and parts.

5. A `try/catch` block is used to handle any errors that may occur during the multipart upload process.

6. A new `CreateMultipartUploadCommand` instance is created with the S3 parameters defined in `params`. This command creates a new multipart upload and returns the `UploadId`.

7. The `UploadId` is stored in the `uploadId` variable.

8. An event listener is added to the `busboy` instance for when a file is received. When a file is received, a new `UploadPartCommand` instance is created with S3 parameters including the `uploadId`, the part number, and the file contents. This command uploads the part to S3 and returns the ETag of the uploaded part.

9. The `ETag` and `PartNumber` are stored in the `parts` array.

10. An event listener is added to the `busboy` instance for when the upload is finished. When the upload is finished, a new `CompleteMultipartUploadCommand` instance is created with S3 parameters including the `uploadId` and the array of parts. This command completes the multipart upload.

11. A success response is sent to the client indicating that the file was uploaded successfully.

12. The incoming request is piped to the `busboy` instance to start the upload process.

13. If an error occurs during the upload process, it is caught in the `catch` block and an error response is sent to the client.

14. The `uploadFileToS3` function is exported for use in other modules.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
